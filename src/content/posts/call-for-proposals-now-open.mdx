Our specialist tracks need your support to fill a full schedule! Take some time to [learn more about specialist tracks](/cfp/specialist-tracks) at PyCon AU 2026 and make sure you submit your talk ideas early!

## Talk writing workshops
PyCon AU is an actively welcoming environment for first time speakers. To support new and returning speakers, we're hosting a series of talk writing workshops around Australia to help you brainstorm and draft your talk proposals.

As of today there are 5 workshops, scheduled in Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane, and two online for remote participation. We hope to add more locations and dates really soon - so watch this space!

## Need a mentor?
Several previous speakers at PyCon AU have volunteered to provide feedback and mentorship during this year's CFP. These mentors are happy to offer feedback on your proposal ideas, review your drafts, and to help you improve your abstracts prior to the CFP deadline. _Please be respectful of our mentor's time as they are volunteers._

To get connected to a mentor, please email program@pycon.org.au with a brief outline of your talk topic but <u>do not include your draft abstract</u>. We'll do our best to connect you with a mentor to help.

**Top tip**: Reach out early, as mentors are always busy in the lead up to CFP closing.
