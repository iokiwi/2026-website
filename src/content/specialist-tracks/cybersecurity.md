In today's cyber threat landscape, security cannot be an afterthought.  Developers, operations, and management need to address cybersecurity at every stage of the technology lifecycle.  The Cybersecurity track will bring talks from the cutting edge of security, from understanding the current and emerging threats, to defensive engineering and incident response.  We invite software developers and cybersecurity practitioners of all kinds to share your in-depth knowledge, practical skills, and war stories with PyCon Australia's diverse audience.  Presentations do not need to have a specific Python angle but should be relevant to people who use Python.

**This track would be great for:** software developers, systems/infrastructure administrators, cybersecurity practitioners, and managers and CISO types who want to keep their finger on the pulse of cybersecurity.

**This track would love talks from:** Red teamers, blue teamers, GRC folks, software developers, vulnerability researchers
