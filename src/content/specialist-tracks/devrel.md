Speakers, tutors, and instructors unite: Expert and aspirational Developer Relations (DevRel) folk gather to share experiences and teachings! This track will be half formal sessions, half unconference, as folks from around the Developer Relations industry share their experience and insights. We invite those with DevRel titles to submit presentations, and participate in the unconference, helping share their insights with their peers, and those interested in the profession.  
We plan to take part of our track into an "unconference" mode: we will run [open spaces](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/), with the content of these spaces decided on the day with the people who participate. 

(i) The unconference will not be recorded.

**This track would be great for:** everyone currently in DevRel, or interested in DevRel.

**This track would love talks from:** Developer advocates, community managers, meetup organisers, hackathon coordinators (and more!)
