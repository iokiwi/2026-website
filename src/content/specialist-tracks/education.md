Learn about learning, teach about teaching, and educate about education! 
Do you code with kids? Tinker on educational teachings? Has your Python programming in schools gone fabulously, or terribly? We'd love to hear about it! 

Python programming is becoming more common in education settings, whether taught as part of the Digital Technologies classrooms, integrated across the curriculum, or embedded in coding clubs. We want to hear from teachers, education professionals, edutech enthusiasts and more about what’s worked, what hasn’t and everything in-between!

**This track would be great for**: anyone teaching Python - whether in primary, secondary, tertiary education or just for fun!

**This track would love talks from**: Python educators in any setting, formal or informal.
