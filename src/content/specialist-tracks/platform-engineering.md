Do you find yourself empowering other engineers (or AI) in their development and getting their code to production quickly, cheaply, safely, and in an observed manner?

This is Platform Engineering, which is too often at an intersection with Python!
Come and meet, learn, and share stories with others, and leave with insights to grow your platform!

**This track would be great for:** Any kind of engineer looking to be empowered, or engineers who empower others (Platform/Infra/DevOps/SRE/SysAdmin/DevX)

**This track would love talks from:** Any kind of engineer who has worked with systems or tooling to support others, or has war stories to share!
