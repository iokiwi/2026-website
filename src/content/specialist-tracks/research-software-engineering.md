This track includes topics related to:
* the use of software engineering practices within Python and mixed-language code bases, especially code used for research or created by researchers
* the use of Python-based software tools (e.g. Spack) within the research software engineering (RSE) ecosystem.
* building bridges between the Python and RSE communities.

**This track would be great for:** Researchers, managers and software engineers thinking of using Python and software engineering practices to make software more robust and more usable for reproducible research.

**This track would love talks from:**
* People who manage research software engineers and have experience in assessing RSE contributions to the value of research programs, assessment of RSE skills and training of RSEs.
* People who have been involved in an interesting project where a significant research code base has been created, refactored or otherwise made more usable.
* People who have made a career change from researcher to research software engineer.
Everyone with a story that shows why research software engineering is cool and valuable.
