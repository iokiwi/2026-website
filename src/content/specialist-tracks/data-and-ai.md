The Data & AI specialist track covers the full spectrum of how we use Python to work with data and build effective autonomous systems. This includes data analysis, visualisation, data engineering, machine learning, and the emerging discipline of AI engineering—designing safe, and reliable workflows with generative AI and large language models. We're also keen to hear about the human side: ethics, evaluation, and the societal impacts of the systems we build.

Whether you're wrangling datasets, training models, or integrating AI into production systems, this track is for you.
