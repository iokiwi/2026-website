                Thanks to the support of our sponsors, we have budget set aside
                for providing financial assistance to anyone who might
                otherwise find it difficult to attend. This includes both speakers and attendees.
              </p>
              <h2 id="about">About Financial Assistance</h2>

              <p>
                Financial assistance grants take the form of reimbursement for
                expenses incurred in getting to and presenting at the conference.
              </p>  
              <p>
                These expenses can include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Flights or other transport to Brisbane</li>
                  <li>Accommodation costs</li>
                  <li>Other costs associated with attending such as a support worker, child care or a substitute teacher.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Please ask only for what you need in order to be able to attend
                the conference and highlight any opportunities you would use to save
                costs, such as finding cheaper accommodation further from the city
                (public <a href="/attend/transport">transport in Brisbane</a> provides easy access to the venue).
              </p>

              <p>
                Grants are available to both speakers and delegates attending PyCon AU,
                and the application process is the same regardless if you are applying to speak.
              </p>

              <h2 id="application">Application</h2>

              <h2 id="reimbursement">Reimbursement Process</h2>
              <p>
                If granted assistance, you will still be expected to organise
                and purchase travel and accommodation yourself and request reimbursement.
                You will be given a maximum amount of reimbursement based on the
                assistance you requested. Once assistance is granted, you can start
                making bookings and sending us your receipts.
              </p>
              <p>
                If possible, we ask that you submit your reimbursement requests in batches.
                For example you might request airfares and deposits early on, and then submit
                a second request for accomodation and incidentals after the conference.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your grant confirmation email will outline the requirements for receipts
                and proof of payment, as well as how to submit receipts for reimbursement.
              </p>
              <p>If you have any questions about financial assistance please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@pycon.org.au">contact@pycon.org.au</a></p>

              <h2 id="financial-assistance-for-attendees">Financial assistance for attendees</h2>
              <p>
                We are hoping to provide financial assistance for attendees who might otherwise find it difficult to attend. If we are able to provide it, attendee financial assistance would include either:
                 <ul>
                  <li>a free conference ticket (at the enthusiast level), OR</li>
                  <li>a free conference ticket (at the enthusiast level) plus additional reimbursed expenses as described above</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
              <p>Note that we will only be able to consider applications for attendee financial assistance if you are travelling from within Australia, or from a location in the Pacific/Oceania region that does not have a more appropriate local PyCon.</p>
              <p>Our ability to provide this will depend entirely on how much <a href="/sponsor/">sponsorship</a> we receive, and we will announce the availability financial assistance along with instructions on how to apply if and when we are able.</p>
