                <p>
                  PyCon AU CFP workshops are designed to help prospective speakers prepare and submit strong talk proposals. Whether you're a first-time speaker or a seasoned presenter, our workshops provide valuable insights into crafting engaging and effective proposals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Workshops are free to attend, and obligation free meaning you don't have to commit to submitting a proposal before you attend the workshop. Most workshops will be run by members of the PyCon AU organising team or by experienced speakers from previous PyCon AU conferences.
                </p>

                <h2>How to prepare</h2>
                <p>
                  Workshops are hands on, so bring a laptop or a pen and paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We'll guide you through the process of brainstorming, structuring, and writing your proposal. If you have a specific topic in mind, feel free to bring that along too!
                </p>
                <p>
                  While not required, it might help to already have a Pretalx account set up. You can ask questions about Pretalx at the workshop.

            <h2>Run a CFP workshop with your community!</h2>
            <p>
              Our workshop is open source, and published with a train-the-trainer model in mind. If you'd like to run a workshop with your local community, club or group, we'd love to help you make it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workshop slides, presenters notes, and event resources (agenda + template graphic for promotion) will be published to GitHub, Soon&trade;
            </p>
            <h4>Plan ahead & get in touch</h4>
            <p>
              While the workshop content is freely available, there's a few things that can help make your event run smoothly.
              <ol>
                <li>Plan ahead by at least 2 weeks. This gives attendees time to RSVP and prepare.</li>
                <li>A sit down venue with tables and chairs (and WiFi) is a better format than a standing venue (like a pub)</li>
                <li>Plan to have extra facilitators who can help attendees brainstorm and offer feedback.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

              <span>If you would like your workshop to be published on this page it must have an appropriate Code of Conduct and be free to attend. PyCon AU's code of conduct is open source to use a starting point.</span>
